            <div class="article">
                <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                    son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                    far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>

                <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                    with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself
                    with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
                    speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                    pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
                    and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like
                    spit in the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning
                    of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                </p>
                <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the
                    South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
                    Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the
                    signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
                    trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                    inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
                </p>
                <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                    wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                </p>
                <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                    discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
                    realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
                </p>
                <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
                    with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
                    extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an
                    endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
                    over.
                </p>
                <strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong>
                <p>n our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond
                    the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
                    ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                    Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
                </p>
                <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                    team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                </p>
                <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                    gravitational waves.”
                </p>
                <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                    permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as
                    the surface of the sun.
                </p>
                <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                    Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center
                    for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
                </p>
                <strong>The Theory of Inflation</strong>
                <br>
                <small>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the
                    universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years
                    ago.

                        <p> <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the
                            Milky Way galaxy,
                            we
                            can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a
                            mystery.
                            Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled
                            the vast distance
                            from one side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for
                            scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile
                            in one
                            direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
                            temperature and how much it has cooled.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction.
                            You see a similar
                            coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar
                            cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups
                            from place to
                            place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single
                            coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a
                            trillionth of a second
                            after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in
                            the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the
                            universe.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient
                            fluctuations in swirls
                            of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the
                            early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding
                            faster than light
                            and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the
                            structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

                <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
                <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
                    confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
                <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
                <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
                    Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
                    few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is
                    his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
                <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who
                    chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
                <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of

                <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
                <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think
                    that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr.
                    Linde wrote in an email.</p>
                <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
                    “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
                <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                    spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
                <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will
                    go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>
                <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
                    called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
                    beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>
